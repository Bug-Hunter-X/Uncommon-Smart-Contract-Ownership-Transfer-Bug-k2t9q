# Uncommon Smart Contract Ownership Transfer Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a smart contract's ownership transfer function and its solution.

The bug lies in the insufficient check for a valid new owner address.  While `newOwner != address(0)` prevents assigning ownership to the zero address directly, it doesn't account for other edge cases that could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. 

The solution enhances the validation to ensure robustness and security.
